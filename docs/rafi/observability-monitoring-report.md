# Observability & Monitoring Documentation

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Spongeweb
- **Repository URL**: [Spongeweb Github](https://github.com/Sylphiann/spongeweb)

## Objective

The objective of implementing observability and monitoring is to gain better visibility into the system's behavior, detect issues proactively, and ensure the reliability of the application in production environments.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Monitoring Tool**: [Specify Monitoring Tool, e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic]
- **Logging Tool**: [Specify Logging Tool, e.g., ELK Stack, Loki, Splunk]
- **Tracing Tool**: [Specify Tracing Tool, e.g., Jaeger, OpenTelemetry]

## Key Metrics Monitored

- **Application Performance**: Response time, error rate, latency.
- **Resource Utilization**:
  - **CPU Usage**
  - **Memory Usage**
  - **Disk I/O**
- **Logs**: Application logs, error logs, request and response logs.
- **Health Checks**: Uptime, endpoint availability, database connectivity.
- **User Behavior Metrics**: Number of active users, session duration, request frequency.

## Monitoring Strategy

### 1. Application Metrics

- **Tool Used**: [e.g., Prometheus]
- **Metrics Monitored**:
  - **Request Count**: Tracks the number of incoming requests.
  - **Error Rate**: Tracks the percentage of failed requests.
  - **Latency**: Measures the response time for each request.

### 2. Infrastructure Metrics

- **Tool Used**: [e.g., Grafana]
- **Metrics Monitored**:
  - **CPU Usage**: Percentage of CPU usage per node.
  - **Memory Utilization**: Tracks memory usage to identify potential bottlenecks.
  - **Disk I/O**: Measures read/write speed for data storage.

### 3. Logging

- **Tool Used**: [e.g., ELK Stack]
- **Logs Collected**:
  - **Application Logs**: Track application events and errors.
  - **Access Logs**: Record all incoming requests and their status.
  - **Error Logs**: Capture stack traces and error messages for debugging.

### 4. Tracing

- **Tool Used**: [e.g., Jaeger]
- **Traces Collected**:
  - **Span Data**: Measures the performance of different parts of the application.
  - **Request Path**: Tracks the path taken by each request through the system.

## Dashboard Configuration

- **Monitoring Dashboard**: [e.g., Grafana]
  - **Panels Configured**:
    - **CPU Usage Panel**: Shows the average CPU usage of all nodes.
    - **Latency Panel**: Displays average and peak latency.
    - **Error Rate Panel**: Shows the percentage of requests resulting in errors.
  - **Alert Rules**:
    - **High CPU Usage**: Alert if CPU usage exceeds 80%.
    - **High Error Rate**: Alert if error rate exceeds 5%.
    - **Latency Spike**: Alert if response time exceeds a threshold.

## Alerts and Notifications

- **Alerting Tool**: [e.g., PagerDuty, Slack]
- **Configured Alerts**:
  - **Critical Alerts**: [e.g., Service is down, error rate exceeds 10%]
  - **Warning Alerts**: [e.g., High memory usage, slow response time]
- **Notification Channels**: [e.g., Email, Slack, SMS]

## Implementation Plan for Observability & Monitoring

If observability and monitoring have not yet been implemented, here is the proposed plan:

- **Tool Selection**: [e.g., Grafana and Prometheus for monitoring]
- **Setup**:
  - **Metrics Collection**: Integrate Prometheus to scrape metrics from the application.
  - **Log Aggregation**: Setup ELK Stack for collecting and visualizing logs.
  - **Tracing Integration**: Use Jaeger to trace the request flow.
- **Dashboard Setup**: Configure a Grafana dashboard to visualize metrics.
- **Alerting Setup**: Create alert rules to notify stakeholders of incidents.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Data Overload**: Filtering out irrelevant metrics to focus on key indicators.
- **Performance Impact**: Ensuring that observability tools do not degrade system performance.

## Conclusion

- **Summary of Observability Implementation**: [Summarize the key insights and improvements achieved with observability and monitoring]
- **Next Steps**: [Outline additional measures to enhance observability, such as fine-tuning alerts or adding new metrics]
